## nimatullo dot com

This is my ever changing portfolio website. I've gotten bored of the design and redone it from scratch many times in the past. The current design I've probably had for the longest time.

It's built using Gatsby and its deployed on Netlify. I'm aware Gatsby probably isn't the right framework for a project like this since I'm not using any of the static site generator features; I could've gotten away with just using React.

The `v1` folder contains the first version of my porfolio. I've kept it in this repo as a meme. 

## Currently the website consits of

- [List of my projects](https://nimatullo.com/projects)
- [About me](https://nimatullo/about)
- [Software I use for development](https://nimatullo.com/uses)
- [Books I've read and music I listen to](https://nimatullo.com/culture)
- [Collection of bad programming memes](https://nimatullo.com)
- [Resume](https://nimatullo.com/resume)
